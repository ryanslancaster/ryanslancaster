- 👋 Hi, I’m @ryanslancaster
- 📚 I'm a computer science master's student at Birmingham City University, and am fascinated with emerging web technologies and creative web development.
- 💼 I'm also a freelance web developer passionate about helping clients bring their small businesses, charitable organisations, or creative projects onto the web!
- 🤝 I'm always looking to collaborate with individuals with big ideas for their web presence, so that I can find new and creative ways to work with web technologies.
